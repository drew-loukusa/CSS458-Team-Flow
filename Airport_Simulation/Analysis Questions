#Research Analysis Questions on the Ground Traffic Simulations
1. How does the change of rush hour pattern impact the ground traffic?

2. The impact of mean change on the model

3. The impact of standard deviation change on the model

4. Why is the model in the uniform distribution?

5. What if it is not uniform? 

6. During the rush hours, double up the planes, how will the model be impacted?

7. The sensitivity of the model

8. Based on the simulation results, what suggestions will be given the ground traffic control of Sea-Tac?
